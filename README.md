# WebGL Compute Shader Demo

This is a kludge for demonstrating WebGL compute shaders for 3D textures. Unless you wish to learn about compute shaders, you should evaluate the original [WebGL volume rendering project](https://github.com/rordenlab/rordenlab.github.io)


## Installation

You need to have a web server. You can adjust the settings for any Github page to be served as a web page, allowing you to share your latest commits.

For development, you can serve the files locally using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
```
> http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:

Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
